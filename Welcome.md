Welcome to Swimm! ðŸ‘‹

We believe that a great onboarding process consists of clear hands-on walkthroughs. In Swimm, we call them **Units** - walkthroughs that have been generated from your codebase, by people in your team and organization, to learn and start contributing to. ðŸ˜Ž

**Playlists** are ordered sequences of Units. You are currently within the `Getting Started with Swimm` Playlist. In this short Playlist we will show you how to play a Unit.

If you have any question at all, you can always email us at `info@swimm.io`.
