**Inviting a friend**

&nbsp;

When you are on your “My Swimm Page”, on the top hand corner of the screen you will see the “Invite Swimmer” button. As long as you are the Admin of a repo, you can invite more users to join your Swimm workspace.

**Swimm Support**

We’re just an email away at support@swimm.io or even a chatbot away (Someone from The Swimm R&D team will personally get back to you as soon as possible).
