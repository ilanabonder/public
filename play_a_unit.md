We will now see how to play a **Unit**.

As an example, we will work with a public repo by Swimm - [Python Best Practices](https://github.com/swimmio/python_best_practices/). It consists of hands-on Swimm Units covering best-practices in Python (from basics to advanced), as well as specific modules or libraries (e.g., typing).

If you'd like to Swimm along, you can install this repo by using the following command from your terminal:

`swimm install https://github.com/swimmio/python_best_practices.git`

This repo includes a few Playlists. We will start the one called **Data structures and variables**, and specifically - look at its first Unit, **Printing with Indexes**:

This page provides all relevant info in order to start this Unit.

# Playing the Unit
Click anywhere on the grey box starting with `swimm play` - and this command wil be copied to your clipboard.

Paste that command to your terminal, where your current directory is that of the repository. At that point, you will get a few notes:

When you `swimm play` - the Unit is activated in a different branch called `swimm`. All your operations while playing the Unit will happen in this branch.

On the next step we'll get to know common commands used in Swimm's CLI.
