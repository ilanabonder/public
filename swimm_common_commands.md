Here are some useful commands you will want to get to know:  

- `swimm play`
- `swimm hint`
- `swimm test`
- `swimm files`
- `swimm done`

**Swimm Play**

On the previous step we used `swimm play` and the Unit Key to start the 'Printing with Indexes' Unit inside the repo we are using as an example (python_best_practices). This is what we after entering this command:

In this simple example, as a result of the Unit, we should implement `print_with_indexes`:

Let's walk through other commands that can help us fulfill this task.


**Swimm Hint**

Whenever you are not sure what to do, you can use `swimm hint` - which will provide you hints either automagically generated by Swimm, or created by your team members.

**Swimm Test**

Some Units have tests that cover them. If your Unit has tests - running them using `swimm test` is a good place to start.


**Swimm Files**

`swimm files` will tell you what files are relevant for this Unit.


**Swimm Done**

If you are done with the Unit - you can use `swimm done` to mark it as done.


You will also be prompted to mark the Unit as Done in case the tests in `swimm test` pass.



# Completing the Unit

Now that we know how to solve it, let's implement `print_with_indexes`:

And run `swimm test` to check if it is correct. The tests should pass and we will be prompted to revert our repo to the source branch:

At this point we will also get a summary page:

This page shows a few other helpful things:

* Comparing our solution to the original, best practice one. We can see here that using `enumrate` is an elegant solution in this case.
* A summary - pointing out key takeaways from this Unit.
* We also have a link to edit the Unit - this is a good opportunity to help future Swimmers - by adding extra hints or clarifications.
