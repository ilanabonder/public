On the previous step we used `swimm play`:

In this simple example, we should implement `print_with_indexes`:

# swimm hint
Whenever you are not sure what to do, you can use `swimm hint` - which will provide you hints either automagically generated by Swimm, or created by your team members.

# swimm test
Some Units have tests that cover them. If your Unit has tests - running them using `swimm test` is a good place to start.

# swimm files
`swimm files` will tell you what files are relevant for this Unit.

# swimm done
If you are done with the Unit - you can use `swimm done` to mark it as done.

You will also be prompted to mark the Unit as Done in case the tests in `swimm test` pass.

# Let's complete the Unit
Let's implement `print_with_indexes`:

And run `swimm test`. The tests should pass and we will be prompted to revert our repo to the source branch:

At this point we will also get a summary page - showing a few helpful things:
* Comparing our solution to the original one. We can see here that using `enumrate` is an elegant solution in this case.
* A summary - pointing out key takeaways from this Unit.
* We also have a link to edit the Unit - this is a good opportunity to help future Swimmers - by adding extra hints or clarifications.
